Happy Birthday Julia


The Julia language reached the important milestone of a 1.0 release yesterday.
During a party in the rather swish Institute for Engineering and Technology overlooking the Thames in London, the founders of the Julia language performed a live push of the 1.0 version to Gitbub.

The significance is that the Julia language has often been criticised for changing the language in wauys which break old code at minor version number changes.
The recent 0.7 version was intended as a preview of 1.0, ie there would be no breakign changeds between 0.7 and 1.0. Version 0.7 lasted around a month, and there was a lot of traffic on the Julia discussion board on how packages are being slowly updated to 0.7 compatibility.
Now with version 1.0 we can look forward to a stable language - so if you have not looked at Julia yet this is the ideal time to try it.
